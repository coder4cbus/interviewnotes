## What's a "tuple"? What's a "triple"? What's the difference between a tuple and a set? 
  * A tuple is essentially an array where each index represents a category of some kind, such that you can reliably associate values at a certain index across tuples as being related to that category. 
  * Not sure what a triple is. I would suspect that tuple might be short hand for an array of two that carries this meaning, and a triple would be an array of three? 
  * The difference between a tuple and a set is that a set holds only unique values, but that both are array-like. A tuple does not have a restriction on duplicates.
## What is the average and worst-case time complexity of access, search, and insertion for common data structures? 
 * For each answer, briefly explain why.
 * Cover these data structures: array, queue, stack, singly-linked list, hash table, BST.
## When using git, what exactly do people mean when they talk about "the SHA-1"? 
## How is that related to how git works?
## Practically speaking, how does git rebase function compared to git merge? 
## Present a quick overview of TDD.
 * What are the proposed benefits? How popular is it, really? 
 * What are the arguments against it?
# Is JavaScript a functional language? What does it mean for a language to be "functional"? *
# Practically speaking, what's a "declarative" language? *
  * What's a popular example of one?
# Is JavaScript statically or dynamically typed? Is JavaScript strongly typed or loosely typed? What do those terms mean? *
# Give a brief analogy explaining how computer memory works to a beginning programmer.
  * (No more than a couple of paragraphs, max, please.)
Using official terminology, summarize how Promises work in JS. *
Some terms to use: pending, fulfilled, rejected, resolve, reject, then, catch, all. Cover how chaining/sequencing promises works.
What's an IIFE in JS? When would you use it? *
Hint: IIFE is short for "Immediately Invoked Function Expression".
From memory, write the one-liner that determines if a given string is a palindrome. *
From memory, write the one-liner that generates a random number between two given integers. *
Two lines, rather: Offer variants where the last number is excluded versus included in the range of possible output.
From memory, write the short function to shuffle a deck of cards with complete randomness. *
Hint: You should know the Fisher-Yates shuffle. You shouldn't be deriving random shuffles on the fly, as it will slow you down when doing card-game type problems.
From memory, write the shortest code snippet in JS for cloning an array. *
Hint: it's only about 8 characters long including punctuation.
From memory, write a code snippet that binary-searches an array. *
From memory, write code snippets for BFS and DFS of a BST. *
From memory, write 3 code snippets that do: pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal of a BST. *
What does it mean for coding to be "idiomatic"? Give one example of idiomatic vs non-idiomatic coding in JavaScript. *
There is overhead to sending a request to another machine over the network. Make a (simple) quantitative argument re why it's still often faster to fetch data from Redis vs not using it. *
