### Thief's Knapsack Problem

Code Explanation: 
- Make a table using a range method, to make a large array of arrays. 
- Iterating through items, and then iterating through weights nested inside that. 

### Dynamic Programing:
- Recursion or iteration with memoization 
- Identify repeated work and memoize it
- n fibonacci is a good example
