## Alumni Panel  — April 9, 2018

### General
Exercise a ton
Eat the right foods
Sleep well, work 9-5 everyday hard and then do stuff in the evenings
Hammering algorithms — read textbooks, go through articles
Go for onsites, it is the best practice. Practice is built into it! Your adrenaline will be going
Don’t be afraid of putting yourself out there
Get really good at grep
Get better at git
Ask for help if you are lost
Set up aliases so you don’t have to type extra things

### Effective methods for getting interviews
Anecdotal: 50% onsites from referrals
Big companies likely require really good referrals to get an interview
Don’t give up on the front door, can still work
Take the hacker rank test really seriously, take it early since the pipeline is long
Try to get a referral first, be persistent
If they say no or ignore, bug the next person
If they say no, bug the third person
If they say no, go front door
Send an e-mail of what you want, ask for a referral
Always be polite! Don’t be shy to bug them but always be polite. They will respect the initiative
Get referrals from your own hack reactor network as people get jobs! 
Pay it forward if you get a job, send recruiters to your network, refer people to help them get jobs
Do whatever you can to find a person to focus your application energies, that will make you stand out
Use Dan, Claire, and X (job search post mortem) as resources too! 
Use friends of friends, be open and honest that you are searching for a job and looking for a career change. Ask your friends even if they aren’t in tech, they probably know someone who does.
They work at Collective Health, Quip (part of sales force), LinkedIn in Sunnyvale

### How important is location?
Limiting job search initially to companies you are excited about makes it easier to get excited and also makes it natural to write good cover letters
Take all onsite opportunities, even if you know you don’t want the job

### How important is a portfolio website?
If you have a portfolio great, if you don’t don’t spend too much time on it
Only hack reactor projects is great and enough, more important to talk about CS fundamentals (threading, CPU processors).
Be able to really coherently speak about what you have done. Know how to sell each one.
Usually won’t give a crap about the resume, but sometimes they do and you should know how to back up each bullet point
It is important to put pictures, architecture diagrams on your linkedIn
Keep up contributions on github to show that you are still continously coding 
Contribute to open source projects, participate in hack a thons
Find cracking the coding interview repos with cloned and get green squares from your practice
Performance questions are super important (run time, still work in 1M queries per second)
Know how many bytes an INT is and a STRING, what is a bit vector, exponent math! How big of an array can you have
Use whether they talk about strictly just coding or also who you are as a teammember, it shows the company values a bit. Good companies will want to know if you are compatible and who you are, not just your base knowledge. 

Check post mortem doc for good interview questions
What does on boarding look like? What does improvement look like? fav and least fav things about the job?
Companies will fight to have you, they heed you, use that to your advantage, ask questions. 
Worst thing is to get a job that sucks!! 
The interview is a two way street

### Managing Anxiety
Stop studying a bit before a phone screen or on-site, just relax or exercise that day
Don’t do multiple interviews in a day, you will be mentally burnt out
Look at interviews as fun and pair programming, make it a conversation you want to be somebody they would want to work with. Do stream of consciousness, be relaxed. 
How you would preform as a teammate, how quickly you integrate feedback, those are more important than specific technical knowledge before hand

### Startups v Big Companies
Big companies might treat you very impersonally, just what can you do, don’t care who you are
Look up the background of the people at the startups, if they come from big companies it may still be that way, but probably more personal.

### Research
Know basics and be able to have a conversation like a date, don’t need to overdo research
Ask for a demo of something and they may do it
If you are generally interested, download the app and click around
Ask questions, know info form the website and act curious
Prepare to answer what drew you to our company? Ask about who is biggest competitor and what differentiates you? 

### Bootcamp Stigma
Front door is tougher because of bootcamp
But once you in it doesn’t matter as much
Ask for coding challenges if you are turned away cold
No secret that it is first engineering job, you want to be mentored, don’t be afraid of that. 
Can be a selling point that you made a huge change in your life and shows initiative
Can spin bootcamp as a great trait, if they judge it you don’t want to work for them anyway
Stand out!
