### Job Search Q & A 

Leveraging offers
  - difficult to time
  - if company a gives offer, go to company b and say hey i'm very interested but i did receive an offer, but i'm particularly interested in working with you, i'd hate to accept an offer somewhere else if i could have been with your team. do you have a timeline for making a decision?
  - they may reject you now, which you can overcome
  - they may give you more info
  - or they may just give you an offer and you can compete
  - you can also ask company a for an extension
  - you could make a hypothetical offer increase and say if you do that i won't bother with this other place
  - don't send the offer itself
  - don't send contracts around 
  - don't have to say the name of the company

If you start negotiating are you obligated? Not if you don't say you would, if it is just curiousity. 

High attention but low attachment!! 
- That is a safe approach

Great internships are valuable, but otherwise no

Contract work
  - contracts could be good or bad, big companies like facebook, google, etc usually start you off as a contract and then hire permanently

It is a show me industry not a tell me industry, if in doubt, ask for coding challenge

Yes reapply, might not have wait periods.

If you don't get an offer, don't assume you are rejected, they might just not have had enough spots for you right now. 

Expecting an offer can be used to gin up interest once you are part way through, once you have built up comfort capital.

You can cite the average on the website, or use glassdoor. 

Small is CEO or CTO,
Mid is engineering managers
Large is recruiters

Move past gatekeepers, get to decision makers
Send polite followups two days

Try triple byte in a few weeks, it is super hard

Three followups in a row and then consider dead. 
First email goes with application, 5 business days followup, three business days followup, then dead for now. 

If you send your application not through the portal. Send your cover letter as the body of your e-mail, your resume is the attachment. Don't send more than one attachment. 

Try hired, put years of experience as at least 2, minimum salary that is real.
