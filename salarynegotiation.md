## Salary Negotiation

### Big Picture
- Employers are willing to negotiate
- Majority offer lower at first because they are willing to negotiate
- If you don't negotiate you are leaving like $5000 on the table
- First impressions are important
  - negotiating tactfully indicates your value
  - successful negotiation is not adversarial
- you have leverage
  - 1,000,000 coding jobs are unfilled due to lack of skilled workers
  - there are lots of jobs and not enough people to fill them
  - the industry will grow by 24% until 2026
- this is business
  - being agreeable won't result in more income
  - no one wants to pay more than what's required
  - they give the lowest offer they think a qualified candidate would be willing to accept

### Conversation vs Negotiation
- conversation is everything before you get an offer
- conversation is important and leads to negotiation
- negotiation doesn't happen until you have an offer
  - its only an offer when they say how much they wanna pay you
  - get it in writing
- what are ways to positively influence the conversation?
  - be on time
  - crush interview
  - build rapport
- why is it bad to negotiate before receiving the offer?
  - you are showing your hand 
  - comes off as presumptuous 
  - makes more sense to postpone salary conversation so that you can demonstrate your value
  - avoid sticker shock
  - we are the perfect blue jeans (see value before cost)
  - DO NOT SAY THE NUMBER FIRST
    - they may offer more than you expect
    - if you say the large number first
      - anchoring is a cognitive bias, rely too heavily on the first piece of information to anchor the decisions
      - this is a negotiation technique not a conversation technique 
    - don't freak out about low offers, that is time to negotiate
  - How do you respond if asked to give a number 
    - make $1M expectation joke
    - what is the salary range for this position
    - i'd love to talk about that further down the road
    - we don't know enough yet 
    - i don't know enough about the role
- worthwhile to check glass door
- if the pressure is on to get a first number
  - acknowledge their position and politely repeat your answer using different words
  - "i completely understand where you're coming from, but like i said i'm more interested in what companies are offering across the market"
  - it is illegal to ask about current/previous salary
  - "i'd prefer not to say what my urrent salary is because if it's higher than what you expect to pay for this job, I owuldn't want that to eliminate me from being considered for this job -- because I might be willing to accept less for the right position-- and if it's lower than what this job would pay, I wouldn't want to sell myself short either -- I'm sure you can understand
  - if the application asks for desired salary, enter 0 and explain later, or put in "negotiable"
  - common sense, phd versus restaurant manager, two different roles, versions of experience
- USE YOUR OWN WORDS

### Talking numbers

### Offers

- The flinch
  - repeat the number, think audibly, pause for 3 seconds
  - if they sit through the silence, with any important career decision i'd like to see it in writing and sleep on it for a night or two...
  - that delay is an extended flinch

- we don't negotiate means we are bad at negotiating

- offer will have a number
- get it in writing
- if you say the number first it is hard to negotiate from that
- you may wish to counter initial offer
  - if you do, go as high as your stomach will allow
  - ask for everything you want in the first offer (vacation, remote, etc)
- offers are almost never rescinded

#### do your homework
- research salary range, glassdoor, salary.com, payscale.com, indeed.com 
- larger companies typically pay around the market rate
- smaller companies can vary (low or high)
- set a walk away baseline number
- don't walk away until you've tried to negotiate the offer
- average out your expenses from the past few months, add 10% 
- respond with a specific number as a baseline
  - $105,450 is better than $105,000
  - shows that you have done some research, percentage of market avg
- shoot for the upper end of the market rate

#### is it an offer?
- trial employment periods
- build app as coding challenge
- we don't have enough money to pay you but great opportunity or equity
- these all have inherent disadvantages 

### Equity
- you own part of the comapny
- share in company's gains
- equity varies dramatically between companies
- investing time
- understand the risk

### Homework on Equity
- is there an exit strategy
- plan to sell? take company publi?
- perscentage of hownership
  - employee equity pool normally 10-20% of total 
  - what's the company's value
- stock options or restricted stock
- what's vesting schedule
- when can i sell

### Takeaways
- Always talk to your couch before and during offers
- negotiating is about your value and a good investment, not that you 'need the money'
- keep applying until you accept a written offer
