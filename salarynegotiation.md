## Salary Negotiation

### Big Picture
- Employers are willing to negotiate
- Majority offer lower at first because they are willing to negotiate
- If you don't negotiate you are leaving like $5000 on the table
- First impressions are important
  - negotiating tactfully indicates your value
  - successful negotiation is not adversarial
- you have leverage
  - 1,000,000 coding jobs are unfilled due to lack of skilled workers
  - there are lots of jobs and not enough people to fill them
  - the industry will grow by 24% until 2026
- this is business
  - being agreeable won't result in more income
  - no one wants to pay more than what's required
  - they give the lowest offer they think a qualified candidate would be willing to accept

### Conversation vs Negotiation
- conversation is everything before you get an offer
- conversation is important and leads to negotiation
- negotiation doesn't happen until you have an offer
  - its only an offer when they say how much they wanna pay you
  - get it in writing
- what are ways to positively influence the conversation?
  - be on time
  - crush interview
  - build rapport
- why is it bad to negotiate before receiving the offer?
  - you are showing your hand 
  - comes off as presumptuous 
  - makes more sense to postpone salary conversation so that you can demonstrate your value
  - avoid sticker shock
  - we are the perfect blue jeans (see value before cost)
  - DO NOT SAY THE NUMBER FIRST
    - they may offer more than you expect
    - if you say the large number first
      - anchoring is a cognitive bias, rely too heavily on the first piece of information to anchor the decisions
      - this is a negotiation technique not a conversation technique
