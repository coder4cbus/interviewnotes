## Game Theory Lecture

* Applying the idea that all parties are logical decision makers to your recruitment process. 

* Company is trying to determine your "objective value" in terms of unskilled to skilled. 

* "Objective value" isn't easy for them to determine, it is based on the quality of a very small sample of your performances. 

* While you have a variance of performances, the company also has variance of performances, even if it seems like their "bar" is out of your league. On any given day you can likely reach into their league with just a bit of luck.

* Imposter syndrome can make you think that your "objective value" is very low, especially when you have only your first one or two interviews. 

* Going on lots of interviews is the best thing you can do to improve and to improve your self-confidence

### Takeaways: 
  * Don't extract value from a single data point
  * No connection between performance on interviews and who you are
  * Interviews are human beings, they might not be good too
  * Question your own mental model of what is a good company or a bad company, don't judge until you get the offer, or at least until an on-site. 
  * Focus on moving your bell curve to the right!

### Moving the Bell Curve

* Focus on controllable factors
  * sleep / mood (rituals are useful)
  * identify gaps -> remediate
* Technical Skills
  * General coding competence
  * Diversity study topics
  * For cracking the coding interview, focus most on the toughest areas for you, don't just go front to back
* Interview Performance SKills
  * Whiteboarding, behavioral, communication
  * Be calm, comfortable, and assured

### Effective Communication

* Strike a balance between four things:
  * Company Investment
    * Before onsite they are weeding you out
    * At onsite they want it to be you because they have invested in you
    * They wrote a job description, post to job board, read resumes, interviewed candidates, extend offer
  * Personal Investment
    * Researched the company, reached out to people to talk them
    * Written a cover letter, done a phone screen or coding challenge 
  * Tension
    * No one likes tension
    * They don't like awkward silence
    * They want to resolve tension by giving what you want
    * They also have loss aversion
    * You've been doing this since you were a child
    * Ask difficult questions, disagree, use silence as tool
      * What's one thing you wish was different about your job?
      * If there were one thing you could do to improve the company, what would it be?
      * Where do you see the company in 5 years?
      * What is the biggest challenge facing the company today?
      * Who is your biggest competitor?
      * How important is diversity and inclusion to the company? 
      * Use sandwhich method, end on a positive (what is your favorite thing about working here?)
    * Don't interrupt or apologize unnecessarily
    * Disagreeing effectively requires tact, don't just be contrarian 
  * Comfort (Rapport)
    * Super important to build a relationship or sense of pleasantness to interact. Be friendly. 
    * Talk about anything but code
    * Make connections
    * Search for commonalities, start off on the right foot
    * Be chill about the eye contact
    * Ask them questions about themselves or experiences

### Striking the balance
  * Tension creates a sense of urgency
  * Too much tension might make you arrogant or inflate expectations
  * Sweet spot is equilibrium of mutual investment, comfort, but tension that they know you have options and they feel they must give offer urgently.

### Examples of disagreements
  * If they say we want someone with more experience, you say, you're right isn't that incredible how much I've done in such a short time, imagine what I can do in a year here.
  * We don't hire bootcamp grads, you say, I undestand why you feel that way since immersives are relatively knew, but would you reject all college grads because of a few bad experiences or would you judge on their merit? I'd love an opportunity to show you waht I can do through a coding challenge. 

### Handling questions about your application status
* If they ask you about your pipeline, you say I'm in various stages of the application process with several different companies. 
* I'm interviewing with a few different places, but I don't think it is particularly pertinent to this conversation
* Think of yourself as interviewing in a vacuum. 
* Don't lie, karma is a thing. Be vague or omit if necessary, don't outright lie. 

### Questions to show competence
* Ask about their tech stack and projects
* Based on our conversation is there any reason you would not want to give me this job? They might tell you reservations and you can defend yourself or quell their worries. Good question to ask regardless of how you did, but it is easier when it has gone well. This question can be asked at any stage, phone screen, on-site, etc.
