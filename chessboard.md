### Chessboard

Notes:
1) A chess board contains 64 squares
2) Each player has 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, and 8 pawns. 
3) The goal of the game is to checkmate the other king.
4) See more about rules of movement here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess#Gameplay
5) We expect some discussion of scalability failure scenarios and how those would be addressed.
